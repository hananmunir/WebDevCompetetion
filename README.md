#GENERAL IDEA OF APP
The app lets user register on the website and helps them track their glucose levels, blood pressure and weight. They can log their info and maintain records. 
The app is user friendly, uses modern UI and is simple to use. It is also mobile responsive, the color schemes used are selected to psychologically promote health awareness and healthcare.


#REASON FOR TECHNOLOGY
MERN is one of the most popular Web Dev Stack, I used react because it has a large community of developers and there are alot of libraries. Plus it is easy to get technical support  for react. Node is becoming popular day by day, it is light, scalable and provides cross-platform application.
